## <a name="Outline">Outline</a>

A clone of the popular social media platform which rhymes with chitter. Built with Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL.

## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

This challenge started with going over the foundational skills from this week's Bookmark Manager challenge, such as using a database to persist data across sessions. It also allowed me to hone my knowledge of some more advanced topics such as RESTful routes and use of the MVC approach to web apps.
